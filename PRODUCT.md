# Project Principles

- Keep it focused. The most common pitfall in the blockchain space is the problem of over-generalization. We love building protocols and therefore we are inclined to generalize. But in building _applications_ we must avoid the urge to generalize and remain focused on the niche.
- User experience comes first. The other common pitfall in the blockchain space (by the nature of its infancy) is that applications require a tangle of addresses, signatures, and contract data to interact. But we believe we've come far enough such that a user operating on web3 should hardly even have to know they're interacting with the blockchain unless they're interested in the space. In 2020, a web3 app should look like any other webapp.
- we all have full time jobs and lives outside of this. be respectful of other contributors and be respectful of their time.
