# pulp and pnlp
_pnlp is a placeholder name for the reference client of the pulp protocol_

Our accomplishments are two-fold:
* we've formulated a protocol for the publication and subscription of blog content
* we've implemented a reference client for that protocol

The protocol is composed of 6 procedures:

Each procedure outlines an interaction between the pulp client, the ethereum network s

The client we built for HackFS implements the first four procedures. We intend to implement the fifth for Apollo.
