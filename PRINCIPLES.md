# Project Principles

We aim to build an experience that channels constructive ideas and discourages destructive and aggressive ideas.

It is easy to imagine a platform that enables the free exchange of ideas as a panacea. This is a mistake. A platform that carries information freely will instead inevitably reflect those who use it: the good, the bad, and the ugly of humanity. If the creators of a protocol blind themselves to the downsides, they cannot anticipate and combat the dangers.

If a protocol is indifferent to the information that flows across it, it is up to the designers of the client to channel the user toward expressing those ideas that are constructive instead of those that are destructive and aggressive. We believe that it is a human right to publish ideas for the world to hear; but we are also cognizant of the power this right carries. Thus, we proceed carefully and with self-awareness, lest the technology run away with itself.

Ultimately it is the author of destructive and aggressive ideas that is responsible for them. The protocol is no more liable than the copper wires that carry them or the air through which they reverberate when spoken. But in designing the user interface of this medium, we see an opportunity to nudge ideas into the realm of construction and dissuade those authors who might engage in destruction or aggression.
